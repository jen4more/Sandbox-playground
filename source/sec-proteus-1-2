<title>PROTEUS exercises</title>
    <p>
    As noted in <xref ref="PA-1-2" text="type-global"/>, we are interested in studying the behavior of the output of a function as the input value gets closer and closer to a specified chosen number.  One way to visualize this process is to think about a bug walking along the graph of a function, as pictured here:

    </p>
    <exercise component="proteus" label="proteus-und-limits"  xml:id="proteus-und-limits" attachment="yes">
        <p>
       Focusing on the bug, the <m>x</m>-value that the bug is directly above is the corresponding input value to the function, and the <m>y</m>-value at the bug's height (directly across from the bug) is the corresponding output value of the function.  In the figure here, the bug's position corresponds approximately to the point <m>(1.6, f(1.6)) = (1.6, 1.9).</m>
       <\p>
       <p>
       If the bug walks along the curve in such a way that it gets closer and closer to the location where <m> x = 0 </m>, what happens to the corresponding function value that corresponds to the bug's height?  Does it matter if they approach the location where <m>x = 0</m> from either the left side or the right side of <m>x = 0</m>?
